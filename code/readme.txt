Need to run this code completely, first run itemCF.py, then add the generated output.txt to the same folder as BPR.py, and then run BPR.py to get the mixed result
If you want to get the result before mixing, please modify line 51.52 of scores.py and change line 55 to the correct size
If you encounter any problems, please contact me, I guarantee that the code can run completely, thank you
